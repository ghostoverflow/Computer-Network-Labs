a. What path do the packets follow initially? And why?
Initial route: 0-1-2-3
Minimum path to destination node. Because of DV algo

b. What path do the packets take after the link fails? And why?
Route: 0-6-5-4-3
Because after link 2-3 down, the only path left is 0-6-5-4-3

c. If we remove the Distance Vector Algorithm, what path the packets follow after
the link fails? And why?
The packets will be lost, beaucse they won't change path that was because of DV algo.
